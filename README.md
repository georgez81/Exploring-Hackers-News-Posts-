# Exploring-Hackers-News-Posts
In this project I used SQL to query the data and python to analyze posts on Hacker News particularly posts that begin with "Ask HN" or "Show HN." I was able to work with strings, dates, and times in python as well as being able to utilize object oriented programming. The questions that helped guide my analysis were: 
1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? 
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
